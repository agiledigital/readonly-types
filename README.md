A collection of readonly TypeScript types inspired by TypeScript's built-in readonly types (`ReadonlyArray`, `ReadonlyMap`, etc) and by [is-immutable-type](https://github.com/RebeccaStevens/is-immutable-type).

The types here are all fully `Immutable` following [is-immutable-type#definitions](https://github.com/RebeccaStevens/is-immutable-type#definitions).

## Installation

```sh
# yarn
yarn add readonly-types

# npm
npm install readonly-types
```

## Usage

```TypeScript
// Here's an example using ReadonlyURL.
import { ReadonlyURL } from "readonly-types";

// This is fine.
const hasFooSearchParam = (url: ReadonlyURL) => url.searchParams.has("foo");

// But this won't compile.
const setFooSearchParam = (url: ReadonlyURL) => url.searchParams.set("foo", "bar");
```

## The Types

The second column contains the types provided by this library (which are all `Immutable`). The columns to the right of it show the types being replaced and what level of immutability they achieve by default.

The first column ("Even Better ðŸš€") contains types that are more than just immutable versions of the types in the later columns. These "even better" options require more effort to adopt than those in the second column (or may not even be generally available yet), but they're worth considering if you want something that is more closely aligned with a pure typeful functional programming approach.

| Even Better ðŸš€ | Immutable | ReadonlyDeep | ReadonlyShallow | Mutable |
|----------------|-----------|--------------|-----------------|---------|
| [ImmutableMap or similar](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map#objects_vs._maps) | `ReadonlyRecord` | | | [`Record`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#recordkt) |
| | `ReadonlyURL` | | | [`URL`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL) | 
| | `ReadonlyURLSearchParams` | | | [`URLSearchParams`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams) |
| [Temporal](https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/) (stage 3 proposal, aims to solve various problems in `Date`, including its mutability) | `ReadonlyDate` | | | [`Date`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) |
| [PrincipledArray](https://github.com/agiledigital/readonly-types/issues/7) (does not return mutable arrays from methods like `map`), purpose-built immutable data structures | `ImmutableArray` | `ReadonlyArray`, [immutable-js](https://github.com/immutable-js/immutable-js/)'s `List` | | `Array` |
| purpose-built immutable data structures | `ImmutableSet` | `ReadonlySet`, immutable-js's `Set` | | `Set` |
| purpose-built immutable data structures | `ImmutableMap` | `ReadonlyMap`, immutable-js's `Map` | | `Map` |
| | `ReadonlyWeakSet` | | | [`WeakSet`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakSet) |
| | `ReadonlyWeakMap` | | | [`WeakMap`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakMap) |
| [fp-ts's `Either`](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/modules/Either.ts.html) | `ReadonlyError` (and friends) | | | [`Error` and friends](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects#error_objects) |
| | `ReadonlyRegExp` | | | `RegExp` |
| [fp-ts's `TaskEither`](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/modules/TaskEither.ts.html), and eventually [Effect](https://www.effect.website/docs/what-is-effect) | `ReadonlyPromise` | `Promise` | | |
| | `DeepImmutable` | | | [`DeepReadonly` from ts-essentials](https://github.com/ts-essentials/ts-essentials/blob/master/lib/types.ts#L156-L181), which when used will produce a mix of `Mutable` and `ReadonlyDeep` types |

## Linting

You can ban the mutable counterparts to these readonly types using [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [no-restricted-globals](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-restricted-globals) and [typescript-eslint/ban-types](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/master/packages/eslint-plugin/docs/rules/ban-types.md).

```javascript
  rules: {
    "@typescript-eslint/ban-types": [
      "error",
      {
        types: {
          Record: {
            fixWith: "ReadonlyRecord",
          },
          URL: {
            fixWith: "ReadonlyURL",
          },
          URLSearchParams: {
            fixWith: "ReadonlyURLSearchParams",
          },
          Date: {
            fixWith: "ReadonlyDate",
          },
        },
      },
    ],
    "no-restricted-globals": [
      "error",
      { name: "URL" },
      { name: "URLSearchParams" },
      { name: "Date" },
    ],
  },
```

These lint rules are configured by [eslint-config-typed-fp](https://github.com/danielnixon/eslint-config-typed-fp) for you.

## Purpose-built immutable data structures

Types like `ImmutableArray` and `PrincipledArray` (and even the humble built-in `ReadonlyArray`) can help a lot with correctness but the underlying runtime type remains a mutable `Array`. The same goes for our immutable `Set` and `Map` types. In essence the data structures are the same, we're just constraining ourselves to an immutable subset of their mutable APIs.

One consequence of this is that if someone could get their hands on a mutable handle to one of our values, they could edit it as if it were mutable (e.g. via an `as` type assertion or via an `Array.isArray` check). This forces us to put a little asterisk next to any immutability guarantees we make. You might reach for [Object.freeze](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/freeze) in response to that risk, but that comes with its own issues (performance, compatibility, doesn't show up in the type system, ...).

Another consequence of this is that updating and copying values of these types is needlessly expensive (in terms of compute and memory). A copy of the _entire_ structure must be taken to preserve correctness, even if all we want to do for example is update a single element.

There exist purpose-built immutable data structures that give us an immutable API without the associated performance cost of copying an underlying mutable structure (look for terms like 'structural sharing' and 'copy on write'). If performance is a factor for you, these can be a better choice than the immutable types provided by this package.

To get you started, check out the following:

* https://github.com/immutable-js/immutable-js
* https://github.com/rtfeldman/seamless-immutable

A surprising irony of these types is that they typically aren't truly immutable, for the same reason that `ReadonlyArray` isn't truly immutable. Here's an example:

```typescript
import { Map as ImmutableJsMap } from "immutable";
const foo = ImmutableJsMap([["key", "value"]]);
// This compiles
foo.delete = () => foo;
```

Because `delete` is implemented using method syntax it is necessarily mutable (TypeScript method defined using method syntax cannot be readonly for "reasons"). This is so common that [is-immutable-type#definitions](https://github.com/RebeccaStevens/is-immutable-type#definitions) defines a level of "readonly-ness" called `ReadonlyDeep` that sits below truly `Immutable` but above the mutable levels (`ReadonlyShallow`, `Mutable`).

Depending on how strictly you wish to enforce immutability, `ReadonlyDeep` may or may not be acceptable to you. If it isn't, you can fix it like this:

```typescript
import { Map as ImmutableJsMap } from "immutable";

type TrulyImmutableMap<K, V> = Readonly<ImmutableJsMap<K, V>>;

const foo: TrulyImmutableMap<string, string> = ImmutableJsMap([
  ["key", "value"],
]);

// No longer compiles
foo.delete = () => foo; // Cannot assign to 'delete' because it is a read-only property. ts(2540)
```
